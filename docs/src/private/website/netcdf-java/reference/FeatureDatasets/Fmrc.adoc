= Forecast Model Run Collection (FMRC)
:linkcss:
:stylesheet: ../../cdm.css

A Forecast Model Run Collection (FMRC) is a collection of forecast model output.
An FMRC *featureCollection* supersedes using NcML <<../../ncml/FmrcAggregation#,FMRC Aggregation>>.
In the TDS, one uses a <<../../../tds/reference/collections/FeatureCollections#,FMRC FeatureCollection>>Â element.
This document covers the CDM aspects of FMRC feature collections.

== Overview

Generally, datasets can be broken up by forecast time and/or variable,
and the code automatically figures out what everything is. However, one
cannot put output from multiple runs in the same file; that is, all the
variables in a file are assumed to have a single run time.

The file collections are managed with a
<<../../../tds/reference/collections/FeatureCollections#,CollectionManager>>.
Datasets are opened as GridDatasets, so that the coordinate system information is available.

The ToolsUI FMRC tab allows you to view internal structures of an FMRC.

=== Run Date

If a dateFormatMark is given, a DateExtractor extracts the rundate from
the filename or URL. Otherwise there must be global attributes
*_CoordinateModelBaseDate* or *_CoordinateModelRunDate* inside each
dataset. The GRIB IOSP reader automatically adds this global attribute.

=== Forecast Date

Each file is opened as a GridDataset:

-----------------------------------------
gds = GridDataset.open( mfile.getPath());
-----------------------------------------

and the forecast time coordinates are extracted from the grid coordinate
system.

There is no need to specify *forecastModelRunCollection* vs
**forecastModelRunSingleCollection**, nor **timeUnitsChange**. This is
detected automatically.

=== Opening an FMRC in the CDM

Use static method on ucar.nc2.ft.fmrc.Fmrc:

*public static Fmrc open(String collection, Formatter errlog, Formatter
debug);* +

The collection may be one of:

1.  <<../../../tds/reference/collections/CollectionSpecification#,collection
specification>> string
2.  __catalog__:catalogURL
3.  filename.ncml

=== Regularize

If true, then all runs for a given offset hour (from 0Z) are assumed to
have the same forecast time coordinates. This obviates the need for the
FMRC definition files which previously were used on motherlode. This
evens out time coordinates, and compensates for missing forecast times
in the IDD feed.

=== Persistent Caching

An _fmrInv.xml_ file is made which records the essential grid
information from each file. It is cached in a persistent Berkeley
Database (bdb) key/value store, so that it only has to be done the first
time the file is accessed in an FMRC. Each collection becomes a seperate
bdb database, and each file in the collection is an element in the
database, with the filename as the key and the _fmrInv.xml_ as the
value. When a collection is scanned, any filenames already in the
database are reused. Any new ones are read and added to the database.
Any entries in the database that no longer have a filename associated
with them are deleted.

ToolsUI collections tab allows you to delete database or individual
elements.
