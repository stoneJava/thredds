= Common Data Model

== Overview

Unidata’s Common Data Model (CDM) is an abstract http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model[data model] for scientific datasets.
It merges the
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/[netCDF],
http://www.opendap.org/[OPeNDAP], and
http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/hdf5/[HDF5] data models to create a
common API for many types of scientific data. The NetCDF Java library is
an implementation of the CDM which can read many
<<../reference/formats/FileTypes#,file formats>> besides netCDF.
We call these *_CDM files,_* a shorthand for __files that can be read by
the NetCDF Java library and accessed through the CDM data model__.

The Common Data Model has three layers, which build on top of each other
to add successively richer semantics:

1.  The *_link:#dataAccess[data access layer]_*, also know as the
*_syntactic layer,_* handles data reading and writing.
2.  The *_link:#CoordSys[coordinate system]_* layer identifies the
coordinates of the data arrays. Coordinates are a completely general
concept for scientific data; we also identify specialized
*_georeferencing coordinate systems_*, which are important to the
Earth Science community.
3.  The *_link:#ScientificFeatureTypes[scientific feature type]_* layer
identifies specific types of data, such as __grids__, __radial__, and
__point data__, adding specialized methods for each kind of data.

[[dataAccess]]
== Data Access Layer Object Model

image:CDM-UML.png[CDM UML]

*A Dataset* may be a netCDF, HDF5, GRIB, etc. file, an OPeNDAP dataset,
a collection of files, or anything else which can be accessed through
the netCDF API. We sometimes use the term *_CDM dataset_* to mean any of
these possibilities, and to emphasize that a dataset does not have to be
a file in netCDF format.

A *Group* is a container for Attributes, Dimensions, EnumTypedefs,
Variables, and nested Groups**.** The Groups in a Dataset form a
hierarchical tree, like directories on a disk.There is always at least
one Group in a Dataset, the **root Group**, whose name is the empty
string.

A *Variable* is a container for data. It has a __DataType__, a set of
Dimensions that define its array shape, and optionally a set of
Attributes. Any shared Dimension it uses must be in the same Group or a
parent Group.

A *Dimension* is used to define the array shape of a Variable. It may be
_shared_ among Variables, which provides a simple yet powerful way of
associating Variables. When a Dimension is shared, it has a unique name
within the Group. If __unlimited__, a Dimension’s length may increase.
If _variableLength_, then the actual length is data dependent, and can
only be found by reading the data. A <<VariableLengthData#,variable length Dimension>> cannot be
shared or unlimited, and can only be the innermost (fastest varying) dimension.

An *Attribute* has a name and a value, and associates arbitrary metadata
with a Variable or a Group. The value is a scalar or one dimensional
array of Strings or numeric values, so the possible data types are
(**String, byte, short, int, long, float, double**). The integer types
(**byte, short, int, long**) may be signed or unsigned.

A *Structure* is a type of Variable that contains other Variables,
analogous to a *_struct_* in C, or a *_row_* in a relational database.
In general, the data in a Structure are physically stored close together
on disk, so that it is efficient to retrieve all of the data in a
Structure at the same time. A Variable contained in a Structure is a
*member Variable*, and can only be read in the context of its
containing Structure.

A *Sequence* is a one dimensional Structure whose length is not known
until you actually read the data. To access the data in a Sequence, you
can only iterate through the Sequence, getting the data from one
Structure instance at a time.

An *EnumTypedef* is an enumeration of Strings, used by Variables of type
*_enum_*.

An *Array* contains the actual data for a Variable after it is read from
the disk or network. You get an Array from a Variable by calling
*_read()_* or its variants. An Array is rectangular in shape (like
Fortran arrays). There is a specialized Array type for each of the
DataTypes.

An *ArrayStructure* is a subclass of Array that holds the data for
Structure Variables. Essentially it is an array of *StructureData*
objects.

*<<DataType#,DataType>>* describes the possible types of data:

* The *primitive numeric* types are *_byte, short, int, long, float_* and
*_double_*. The integer types (8-bit byte, 16-bit short, 32-bit int,
64-bit long) may be _signed_ or __unsigned__.

* A *String* is a variable length array of http://unicode.org/[Unicode]
characters. A string is stored in a netCDF file as UTF-8 encoded Unicode
(note that ASCII is a subset of UTF-8). Libraries may use different
internal representations, for example the Java library uses UTF-16
encoding.

* A *char* is an 8-bit byte that contains uninterpreted character data.
Typically a char contains a 7-bit ASCII character, but the character
encoding is application-specific. Because of this, one should avoid
using the char type for data. A legitimate use of *char* is with netCDF
classic files, to store string data or attributes. The CDM will
interpret these as UTF-8 encoded Unicode, but 7-bit ASCII encoding is
probably the only portable encoding.

* An *enum* *type* is a list of distinct (integer, String) pairs. A
Variable with enum type stores integer values, which can be converted to
the String __enum value__. There are 3 enum types: *enum1, enum2,* and
**enum4**, corresponding to storing the integer as a byte, short, or
int.

* An *opaque* type stores uninterpreted blobs of bytes. The length of the
blob is not known until it is read. An array of opaque objects may have
different lengths for each of the blobs.

An *Object name* refers to the name of a Group, Dimension, Variable,
Attribute, or EnumTypedef. An object name is a String, a variable length
array of Unicode characters. The <<Identifiers#,set of allowed
characters>> is still being considered.

=== Comparision to netCDF-4

The CDM data model is close to, but not identical with
the http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf/NetCDF_002d4-Format.html[netCDF-4
data model] (informal http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/workshops/2008/netcdf4/Nc4DataModel.html[UML]).
However there is a complete 2-way mapping between the two models. In the CDM:

* Non-shared dimensions are allowed, but netCDF-4 does not support
these.
* An attribute type may only be a scalar or 1D array of byte, short,
int, long, float, double, or String.
* Variables that are members of Structures may have attributes attached
directly to them.
* The opaque type does not include the length of the opaque object, so
an array of opaque may have different lengths for each object in the
array.
* There are not separate unsigned integer types. The Variable and Array
objects have _isUnsigned()_ methods, and conversion to wider types is
correctly done. Since Java does not have unsigned types, the alternative
is to automatically widen unsigned data arrays, which would double the
memory used.
* NetCDF-4 _user-defined types_ are not kept independently from the
variables that use them, except for __EnumTypedef__. The NetCDF-4
user-defined types are mapped to these CDM constructs:
** A NetCDF-4 _Compound_ is a CDM __Structure__.
** A NetCDF-4 _Enum_ is a CDM _enum1, enum2,_ or _enum4_ and references
a _EnumTypedef_ which holds the (enum, String) map.
** A NetCDF-4 _Vlen_ is mapped to a CDM __variable length Dimension__.
** A NetCDF-4 _Opaque_ type is a CDM _opaque_ type, but the length of
the data cannot be found until you read the variable.

See <<Netcdf4#,here>> for detailed mapping between the NetCDF-4
and CDM data models.

=== Comparision to OPeNDAP (DAP 2)

* OPeNDAP allows nested attributes, but in the CDM, attributes may only
be a scalar or 1D array of byte, short, int, long, float, double, or
String.
* OPeNDAP does not have these data types: __signed byte__, __char__,
__long__, __opaque__, __enum__.
* OPeNDAP does not have shared dimensions. These can be approximated by
map vectors in Grid datatypes, but one cannot share dimensions across
Grids, or between Arrays.
* OPeNDAP does not support Groups.
* OPeNDAP Sequences map to CDM Sequences, but CDM does not support
relational constraints at this layer.

See <<Opendap#,here>> for more details on OPeNDAP processing.

=== Comparision to HDF-5

As of version 4.1, the CDM can read all versions of HDF5 through version
1.8.4, except for the following HDF5 features:

* SZIP compression. The http://www.hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP/[SZIP
library] is proprietary and does not have a Java implementation. Its not
clear if we can even legally write one if we wanted to.
* Dataset region references.
http://www.google.com/search?q=HDF5+region+reference[These] are used in
NPOESS, but their purpose is unclear. Since they point to other datasets
that are accessible through the CDM, all the data in the file can still
be read by the CDM. However, whatever information the region reference
represents is not currently accessible.
* Since HDF5 does not support shared dimensions, however, reading HDF5
files into the higher levels of the CDM (Coordinate Systems, Grids, etc)
may not work like you want. For this reason we recommend using the
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/[netCDF-4 C library] for
writing HDF5 files. Heres
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/developer/en/entry/dimensions_scales[why].
* Hard links that cause cycles in the group structure are ignored. These
break the CDM and netCDF-4 data model, in which groups comprise a tree.
All info in the HDF-5 file is still available to CDM users, but certain
paths that one could call from the HDF-5 library are not available.

Please send file examples if you find a problem with the CDM reading
HDF5 files, other than the ones listed above.

[[CoordSys]]
== Coordinate System Object Model

image:../images/CoordSys.png[CoordSys Object model]

A *_Variable_* can have zero or more Coordinate Systems containing one
or more CoordinateAxis. A CoordinateAxis can only be part of a
Variable’s CoordinateSystem if the CoordinateAxis’ set of Dimensions is
a subset of the Variable’s set of Dimensions. This ensures that every
data point in the Variable has a corresponding coordinate value for each
of the CoordinateAxis in the CoordinateSystem.

A *_Coordinate System_* has one or more CoordinateAxis, and zero or more CoordinateTransforms.

A *_CoordinateAxis_* is a subtype of Variable, and is optionally classified according to the types in **AxisType**.

A *_CoordinateTransform_* abstractly represents a transformation between
CoordinateSystems, and  is either a *Projection* or a **Vertical Transform**.

The <<CoordinateAttributes#AxisTypes,*_AxisType_*>> enumerations are specific to the case of georeferencing
coordinate systems. _Time_ refers to the real date/time of the dataset.
_Latitude_ and _Longitude_ identify standard horizontal coordinates.
_Height_ and _Pressure_ identify the vertical coordinate. _GeoX_ and
_GeoY_ are used in transfomations (eg projections) to __Latitude__,
__Longitude__. _GeoZ_ is used in vertical transformations to vertical
_Height_ or __Pressure__. __RadialAzimuth__, _RadialElevation_ and
_RadialDistance_ designate polar coordinates and are used for Radial
DataTypes. _RunTime_ and _Ensemble_ are used in forecast model output
data. Often much more detailed information is required (geoid reference,
projection parameters, etc), so these enumerations are quite minimal.

=== Restrictions on CoordinateAxes

These are the rules which restrict which Variables can be used as Coordinate Axes:

.  *Shared Dimensions*: All dimensions used by a Coordinate Axis must be shared with the data variable.
This allows _shared Dimension joins_ between data and coordinate Variables. This rule is modified by these exceptions:
..  *String-valued Coordinate Axes* may be represented by variables of
type _char_ with a non-shared dimension representing the string length.
.. *CF Discrete Sampling Geometry* representations of point data, allows explicit *_joins_*
that relax the rules for implicit _shared Dimension joins_.
See <<../reference/FeatureDatasets/CFpointImplement#,CF point data>>
.  *Structures and nested Structures*: When a variable is part of a
Structure, the dimensions used by the parent Structure(s) are considered
to be part of the nested Variable. Therefore, all dimensions used by the
parent Structure(s) of a Coordinate Axis must be shared with the data
variable.
.  *Variable length dimensions and Sequences*: A variable length
dimension is always a private (non-shared) dimension, and therefore
cannot be used by a Coordinate Axis, except when the data variable and
coordinate variable are in the same Structure. For example, a Sequence
is a variable length array of Structures, and the following examples are
legitimate uses of coordinate axes.

[source,java]
----
Structure {
  float lat;
  float lon;
  float data;
    data:coordinates = "lat lon";
} sample(*)
----

[source,java]
----
Structure {
  float lat;
  float lon; 
  
  Structure {
    float altitude;
    float data;
      data:coordinates = "lat lon altitude";
  } profile(*)

} station(*)
----

Also see: <<CoordinateAttributes#CoordSysBuilder,Coordinate System Building>>.

=== Mathematical formalism for Coordinate Systems

Formally, a Variable is thought of as a sampled function whose domain is
an index range; each CoordinateAxis is a scalar valued function on the
same range; each CoordinateSystem is therefore a vector-valued function
on the same range, consisting of its CoordinateAxis functions.

When the CoordinateSystem function is invertible, the Variable can be thought of as a sampled function whose domain is the
range of the Coordinate System, that is, on *R^n^* (the product space of real numbers).
To be invertible, each CoordinateAxis should be invertible.
For a 1-dimensional CoordinateAxis this simply means the coordinate values are strictly monotonic.
For a 2 dimensional CoordinateAxis, it means that the lines connecting adjacent coordinates do not cross each other.
For > 2 dimensional CoordinateAxis, it means that the surfaces connecting adjacent coordinates do not intersect
each other. https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/papers/caron/CoordMath.htm[Details]

=== Current Encodings

When data is stored on disk, it is *_encoded_* into a specific file format.

None of the general-purpose encodings like NetCDF, HDF5, or OPeNDAP have Coordinate Systems as part of their APIs and data models,
so for datasets written in those formats, Coordinate System specification is left to higher level libraries (like HDF-EOS) and to
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/conventions.html[attribute conventions].
(If you are writing netCDF files, we strongly recommend using http://cfconventions.org/[CF Conventions].)
Specialized file formats like GRIB, BUFR, NEXRAD, etc. do have coordinate systems as part of their specifications,
albeit specialized ones. The CDM's intention is to be able to accurately represent these coordinate systems, so that applications
using the CDM have a single API to work with.

NetCDF has long had the convention of specifying a 1-dimensional CoordinateAxis with a *_coordinate variable_*, which is a Variable
with the same name as its single dimension. This is a natural and elegant way to specify a 1-dimensional CoordinateAxis, since there is an
automatic association of the Coordinate Variable with any Variable that uses its dimension.
There is not a similarly elegant way to specify other kinds of Coordinate axes, such as multidimensional CoordinateAxis (_lat(x,y)_) or
when axes share a dimension (_lat(obs), lon(obs)_), and so various attribute conventions have evolved to deal with these,
for example the CF Convention simply lists the CoordinateAxis variables (arguably as simple a solution as is possible):

----
  float lat(y,x);
  float lon(y,x);
  float temperature(y,x);
    temperature:coordinates="lat lon";
----

Note that in this example, there is no CoordinateSystem object, so the
same list has to be added to each Variable, and any CoordinateTransform
specifications also have to be added to each Variable. However, the
common case is that all the Variables in a dataset use the same Coordinate System.

The *ucar.nc2.dataset* layer reads various Conventions and extracts the Coordinate Systems using the *CoordSysBuilder* framework.
We often use a set of internal attributes called the
<<../reference/CoordinateAttributes#,underscore Coordinate>>
attributes as a way to standardize the Coordinate System infomation.
Although these work when used with the Netcdf-Java library, we do not recommend them as a substitute for conventions such as CF.

The HDF5 file format made some http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/developer/en/entry/dimensions_scales[wrong choices]
in trying to support shared dimensions and coordinate variables,
and the netCDF-4 library adds an
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/blogs/developer/en/entry/netcdf4_use_of_dimension_scales[overly complex design] in correcting the problem.
Fortunately, these complexities are hidden from applications by the *netCDF C* and *Netcdf-Java* libraries.

[[ScientificFeatureTypes]]
== Scientific Feature Types

Scientific Feature Types are a way to categorize scientific data. The
CDM Feature Type layer turns CDM datasets into collections of Feature
Type objects, and allows a user to extract subsets of the Feature Types
in coordinate space i.e. using spatial and temporal bounding boxes.
In contrast, the CDM Data Access layer provides array index space
subsetting, and the client application must know how to map array
indices into coordinate values.

With these Feature Types objects, mapping into data models like ISO/OGC becomes possible.

Feature Type definitions, APIs, and encodings are still under development, so applications using these must be able to evolve along with the APIs.
