The `featureCollection` element is a way to tell the TDS to serve
collections of
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/reference/FeatureDatasets/Overview.html[CDM
Feature Datasets]. Currently this is used mostly for
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/tutorial/GridDatatype.html[gridded
data] whose time and spatial coordinates are recognized by the CDM
software stack. This allows the TDS to automatically create logical
datasets composed of collections of files, particularly gridded model
data output, called **Forecast Model Run Collections (FMRC)**.

A Forecast Model Run Collection is a collection of forecast model
output. A special kind of aggregation, called an **FMRC Aggregation**,
creates a dataset that has two time coordinates, called the *run time*
and the **forecast time**. This dataset can then be sliced up in various
ways to create 1D time views of the model output. See this
https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/presentations/caron/FmrcPoster.pdf[poster]
for a detailed example. As of TDS 4.2, you should use the
`featureCollection` element in your configuration catalog. (The previous
way of doing this was with a `datasetFmrc` element, which is now
deprecated.)

The component files of the collection must all be recognized as the
_*Grid*_ Feature type by the CDM software.

=== Exercise: Creating datasets out of the FMRC

Download `catalogFmrc.xml`, place it in your TDS
`${tomcat_home}/content/thredds` directory and add a `catalogRef` to it
from your main catalog:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<catalog xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/thredds/InvCatalog/v1.0"

==== Notes:

1.  All services are defined in a compound service type called
`fmrcServices`.
2.  A THREDDS `featureCollection` is defined, of type `FMRC`. All
contained datasets will all have a `path` starting with `BOM/model`.
3.  All the `metadata` contained here will be inherited by the contained
datasets.
4.  The `collection` of files is defined, using a
<<../reference/collections/CollectionSpecification#,collection
specification string>>. Subdirectories of */machine/tds/workshop/bom/*
will be scanned for files with names that start with "**_ocean_fc_" ,_**
and end with "__*.nc*__". The run data is extracted from the filename.

The contained datasets include the resulting 2D time dimension dataset,
as well as 1D time views described
<<../reference/collections/FmrcCollection#fmrcConfig,here>>, as
seen in the resulting HTML page for that dataset:

The TDS has created a number of datasets out of the FMRC, and made them
available through the catalog interface. Explore them through the
browser, ToolsUI or the IDV.

== Specifying the Run Time

FMRCs are collections of files with (possibly) different run times, and
the software needs to know what that run time is. If you look closely at
the files in this example, you may notice that the run time does not
appear explicitly inside the file anywhere. Luckily the information is
in the filename, which is a common practice.

\1. The recommended way to specify the run time is to specify a _date
parsing template_ in the collection specification string, for example:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<collection spec="/machine/tds/workshop/bom/**/ocean_fc_#yyyMMdd#.*\.nc$" />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

extracts the run date by applying the template `yyyyMMdd` to the portion
of the filename after "`ocean_fc_`".

If the information is in a directory name, then you can use the
dateFormatMark field on the collection element. In our example, an
example dataset paths looks like:
**/machine/tds/workshop/20090330/ocean_fc_20090330_048_eta.nc**. If we
wanted to extract the run time from the directory (pretending we
couldn’t do that from the filename), this is how we would do that:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<collection spec="/machine/tds/workshop/bom/**/ocean_fc_.*\.nc$" dateFormatMark="#workshop/bom/#yyyMMdd" />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that we 1) remove the date extractor from the collection
specification string, and 2) add a *dateFormatMark* attribute. In this
case, the _`#'_ characters delineate a *substring match* on the entire
pathname (so there had better only be one place where the string
"**workshop/bom/**" appears). _Immediately_ following the match comes
the date extractor string. See
<<../reference/collections/FeatureCollections#dateExtractor,here>>
for more details.

\2. The second way to specify the run time is to add a global attribute
inside each file of the collection, with name *_CoordinateModelRunDate*
whose value is the run time as an ISO date string. For example:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    :Conventions = "CF-1.4";
    :Originating_center = "US National Weather Service - NCEP(WMC) (7)";
    :Generating_Model = "Analysis from Global Data Assimilation System";
    :_CoordinateModelRunDate = "2010-11-05T00:00:00Z";

------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Feature Collections that change

The above example creates a static collection of files. A common case is
that one has a collection of files that are changing, as files are added
and deleted while being served through the TDS. Below is an example
dataset, with additional elements and attributes to handle this case:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <catalog xmlns="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/namespaces/thredds/InvCatalog/v1.0"
           xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" name="Unidata THREDDS Data Server"
           version="1.0.3">
    <service name="ncdods" serviceType="OPENDAP" base="/thredds/dodsC/"/>

    <featureCollection featureType="FMRC" name="NCEP-GFS_Global_2p5deg"
                       path="fmrc/NCEP/GFS/GFS_Global_2p5deg">
      <metadata inherited="true">
        <serviceName>ncdods</serviceName>
        <dataFormat>netCDF-4</dataFormat>
        <documentation type="summary">Specially good GFS_Global_2p5deg</documentation>
      </metadata>

      <collection spec="/machine/tds/workshop/gfs/GFS_Global_2p5deg.*\.nc4$"
                  name="GFS_Global_2p5deg"
1)                recheckAfter="15 min"
2)                olderThan="5 min"/>
3)    <update startup="test" rescan="0 5 3 * * ? *" trigger="allow"/>
4)    <protoDataset choice="Penultimate" change="0 2 3 * * ? *" />
5)    <fmrcConfig datasetTypes="TwoD Best Runs ConstantForecasts ConstantOffsets Files" />

    </featureCollection>
  </catalog>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Notes:

1.  `recheckAfter`: When a request comes in, if the collection hasn’t
been checked for 15 minutes,check to see if it has changed. The request
will wait until the rescan is finished and a new collection is built (if
needed). This minimizes unneeded processing for lightly used
collections.
2.  `olderThan`: Only files that haven’t changed for 5 minutes will be
included. This excludes files that are in the middle of being written.
3.  `update`: The collection will be updated upon TDS startup, and
periodically using the cron expression "`0 5 3 * * ? *`", meaning every
day at 3:05 am local time. This updating is done in the background, as
opposed to when a request for it comes in.
4.  `protoDataset`: The prototypical dataset is chosen to be the
``next-to-latest''. The prototypical dataset is changed every day at
3:02 am local time.
5.  `fmrcConfig`: The kinds of datasets that are created are listed
explicitly. You can see how this corresponds directly to the HTML
dataset page above. Remove the ones that you don’t want to make
available. Default is "`TwoD Best Files Runs`"

The *recheckAfter* attribute and the *update* element are really
alternate ways to specify rescanning strategies. Use the *update*
element on large collections when you want to ensure quick response. Use
the *recheckAfter* on lightly used collections in order to minimize
server load. _Don’t use both of them on the same dataset on a real
production server._

<<../reference/collections/FeatureCollections#,reference doc>>.
