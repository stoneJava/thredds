<<GettingStarted#manager,Tomcat manager application>>.

== Why Is Security Important?

=== Be afraid

* Misconfiguration of Tomcat can introduce vulnerabilities in security.
* The following recommendations should be considered ``layers'' of
security: not completely effective by themselves, but more potent when
combined.
* _This is not a complete laundry list of security fixes!_ Please use it
as a starting point when securing your server.
* Suggestions below listed in random order (section ordering is not a
representation of the section importance).

== Keeping Software Versions Up-To-Date

=== Rationale

* Running the most current versions of software keeps your environment
protected against _known_
http://www.securityfocus.com/vulnerabilities[security vulnerabilities].
This includes the JDK, Tomcat, the TDS and any other third-party
libraries or software you run.
* Stay Informed! Subscribe to announcement lists for Tomcat, the TDS and
any other software you deploy, to stay abreast of new versions released
due to security issues.
* As soon as a security issue is disclosed, potential attackers will
begin trying to exploit that vulnerability. It is important that you
upgrade your software before an attacker uses the vulnerability against
you.

== Tomcat Process User/Group and $\{tomcat_home} Permissions

=== Rationale

==== Background info

The JVM doesn’t fork at all, nor does it support `setuid()` calls. The
JVM, and therefore Tomcat, is one process. The JVM is a virtual machine
with many threads under the same process.

* Because of OS constraints, all threads in the same JVM process must
run under the same user id. No thread may run as the `root` user unless
they are all are run as the `root` user. Hence, any programs run in
Tomcat (TDS, `manager` application, other JSPs and servlets) will run as
the `root` user.
* If you choose to run the Tomcat process as the `root` user, and an
attacker manages to exploit a weakness in Tomcat or something running in
`webapps/` to run arbitrary commands, __those commands will be run as
the superuser__!
* We _strongly discourage_ running Tomcat as the `root` user and
recommend creating an unprivileged, dedicated user and group for running
the Tomcat process.
+
===== Create a dedicated user/group for running Tomcat

In this example, both the user and group names will be names `tomcat`,
and the user’s home directory, aka `${tomcat_home}`, is `/opt/tomcat`
(notice the symlink below). The groupadd and useradd commands were run
as the root:

-----------------------------------------
# groupadd tomcat
# useradd -g tomcat -d /opt/tomcat tomcat
# passwd tomcat
-----------------------------------------
* We also recommend restricting the permissions of the Tomcat user/group
within `${tomcat_home}`.

===== Restrict the permissions in `${tomcat_home}`

1.  Change the user/group ownership `${tomcat_home}` to the `tomcat`
user and `tomcat` group:
2.  Change the user/ownership of the `${tomcat_home}/conf` directory to
be owned by the `root` user, have a group of `tomcat` and have a
permission of user/group read only:
3.  Change the user/ownership of the `${tomcat_home}/bin` and
`${tomcat_home}/lib` directories to be owned by the `root` user and have
a group of `tomcat`:
4.  Change the user/group permissions of the `${tomcat_home}/conf`
directory and its subdirectories to give the `root` user and `tomcat`
group read/write permissions. (Depending on the web applications you are
running and/or your virtual host configurations, Tomcat will create a
`${tomcat_home}/conf/Catalina`) directory with corresponding
subdirectories and files for
https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/virtual-hosting-howto.html#Configuring_Your_Contexts[context]
information. Allowing the `tomcat` group to write to
`${tomcat_home}/conf` allow this and prevent errors from appearing in
your Tomcat logs.)
5.  Change the user/group permissions of the files in
`${tomcat_home}/conf` directory to give the `root` user and `tomcat`
group has read-only permissions:

security issues] +
 A lengthy thread in the `tomcat-users` mailing list archives dedicated
to the perils of running Tomcat as the `root` user.

== Removing Unused Web Applications

=== Rationale

It is generally good practice to remove any un-used web applications out
of `${tomcat_home}/webapps`.

Tomcat ``ships'' with several default web applications you may want to
consider removing if they are not being utilized:

* The `ROOT` application is Tomcat’s `DocumentRoot` and contains the
server’s main web page. Give thought to the content that is placed in
`ROOT/`, as it will be readily available. (Note: if you want to utilize
a `robots.txt` file to restrict crawler activity, `ROOT/` is the place
it will go.)
* The `manager` application is used for remote management of web
applications. To use this application, you must add a user with role of
`manager-gui` in `tomcat-users.xml`. Obviously, if you are not planning
to use the `manager` application, it should be removed.
* The `host-manager` application is used for management of virtual
hosts. To use this application, you must add a user with role of
`admin-gui` in `tomcat-users.xml`. If you are not planning to do a lot
of virtual hosting in Tomcat this application should be removed.
* The `examples` application should probably be removed from a
production server to minimize security exposure.
* The `docs` are a copy of the
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/[Tomcat documentation found
online]. Unless you have need for a local copy, removing `docs` would
help to tidy-up `${tomcat_home}/webapps`.

== Using Digested Passwords

=== Rationale

==== Tomcat Realms

A http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/config/realm.html[realm]
element represents a ``database'' of usernames, passwords, and roles
(similar to Unix groups) assigned to those users.

Transport Layer Security

* Passwords stored in clear text are a vulnerability if the host is
compromised.
* Better to have the passwords encrypted using a cryptographic hash
functions (SHA, MD2, or MD5) and then stored in `tomcat-users.xml` file
in the Tomcat `conf/` directory.
* Tomcat can be configured to support digested passwords (this is not
the default setting).
* How it works: When a client makes a request Tomcat will tell the
client that a digested password is required. Based on this dialog, the
client will automatically digest the password entered by the user.

===== Configure Tomcat to use digested passwords

1.  First we need to enable digest passwords support in Tomcat by
modifying a couple of Tomcat Realms in the `server.xml` file in the
Tomcat `conf/` directory.
2.  Create a SHA encrypted version of your password.
3.  Update `tomcat-users.xml`.
4.  Verify digest passwords have been successfully enabled in Tomcat.

==== Troubleshooting

* Check the XML syntax in `tomcat-users.xml` and `server.xml` to make
sure it is well-formed and without error.
* Did you restart Tomcat after you made your changes to
`tomcat-users.xml` and `server.xml` ?
* Any errors will be reported in the `catalina.out` file in the Tomcat
`logs/` directory.
* You do not need to type the encrypted version of your password into
the browser (the browser auto-magically encrypts your password for you
before it transmits it to the server).

== Enabling TLS/SSL Encryption

=== How TLS/SSL works

For more information on how SSL works, Wikipedia details the
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security[steps involved]
during an TLS/SSL transaction.

=== Rationale

* Communication between two servers can be intercepted (i.e., an http
transaction between client and server).
* An attacker can eavesdrop on the conversation and control the relay of
messages between the victims, making them believe that they are talking
directly to each other over a private connection.
* The use of digital certificates adds a layer of security by allowing
the receiver of the message to verify the sender is who he or she claims
to be.
* Any intercepted information that is encrypted also adds a layer of
security (the attacker must take the extra step of unencrypting the data
to view the message).
* Transport Layer Security (TLS), and formerly Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL), is a cryptographic protocol that provides security and data
integrity for communications over TCP/IP networks.
* TLS/SSL allows applications to communicate across a network in a way
designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery.
* TLS/SSL uses a cryptographic system that uses two keys to encrypt
data: a public key known to everyone and a private or secret key known
only to the recipient of the message.
* By convention, URLs that require an TLS/SSL connection start with
`https` instead of `http`.

==== CA-signed Certificates

A self-signed certificate says to your users _``Trust me - I am who I
say I am.''_

A certificate signed by a CA says, _``Trust me - the CA agrees I am who
I say I am.''_

=== TLS/SSL certificates

* A public key certificate is an electronic document which incorporates
a digital signature to bind together a public key with identity
information of the certificate user.
* The certificate can be used to verify that a public key belongs to an
individual.
* The digital signature can be signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) or
the certificate user (a self-signed certificate).
* Unidata _highly recommends_ the use of a certificate signed by a
Certificate Authority (CA).
* Browser warnings for self-signed certificates can be very confusing to
users and make them question the legitimacy of your web site.
* It’s about trust: CA-signed certificates verify your identify to your
users. If the traffic between your server and the client is intercepted,
an attacker can inject their own self-signed cert in the place of yours
and the visitor will likely not notice.
* Self-signed certificates cannot (by nature) be revoked, which may
allow an attacker who has already gained access to monitor and inject
data into a connection to spoof an identity if a private key has been
compromised. CAs on the other hand have the ability to revoke a
compromised certificate, which prevents its further use.

=== Certificate `keystore` file

* A `keystore` file stores the details of the TLS/SSL certificate
necessary to make the protocol secured.
* The Tomcat documentation includes a section on
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/ssl-howto.html#Prepare_the_Certificate_Keystore[importing
your certificate into a keystore] file.
* Tomcat uses the `keystore` file for TLS/SSL transactions. Example:

-------------------------------------------------------------
 <Connector protocol="HTTP/1.1" port="8443" maxThreads="200"
    scheme="https" secure="true" SSLEnabled="true"
    keystoreFile="${user.home}/.keystore"
    keystorePass="changeit"
    clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"/>
-------------------------------------------------------------

==== Enabling TLS/SSL in Tomcat

Modify the Tomcat configuration to enable TLS/SSL:

Based on what we know about Tomcat configuration, which file in
`${tomcat_home}/conf` should we edit to to enable TLS/SSL?

Open `${tomcat_home}/conf/server.xml` with your favorite editor:

---------------
$ vi server.xml
---------------

Locate the `Java HTTP/1.1 Connector` listening on port 8080 and verify
it is redirecting TLS/SSL traffic to port 8443:

------------------------------------
<Connector port="8080"
           protocol="HTTP/1.1"
           connectionTimeout="20000"
           redirectPort="8443" />
------------------------------------

Find and uncomment the `SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector` listening on port 8443
to activate this connector:

-------------------------------
<Connector port="8443"
           protocol="HTTP/1.1"
           SSLEnabled="true"
           maxThreads="150"
           scheme="https"
           secure="true"
           clientAuth="false"
           sslProtocol="TLS" />
-------------------------------

Add a `keystoreFile` attribute to the `SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector` to tell
Tomcat where to find your keystore:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<Connector port="8443"
           protocol="HTTP/1.1"
           SSLEnabled="true"
           maxThreads="150"
           scheme="https"
           secure="true"
           clientAuth="false"
           sslProtocol="TLS"
           keystoreFile="/home/tds/apache-tomcat-8.0.24/conf/keystore" />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since we opted to not use the default `keystore password`, we need to
specify the new password so Tomcat can open the file:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Connector port="8443"
           protocol="HTTP/1.1"
           SSLEnabled="true"
           maxThreads="150"
           scheme="https"
           secure="true"
           clientAuth="false"
           sslProtocol="TLS"
           keystoreFile="/home/tds/apache-tomcat-8.0.24/conf/keystore"
           keystorePass="foobar" />
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Verify TLS/SSL has been enabled.

Restart Tomcat:

--------------------------------
$ ${tomcat_home}/bin/shutdown.sh
$ ${tomcat_home}/bin/startup.sh
--------------------------------

Verify Tomcat is listening on port 8443 by running the `netstat`
command:

------------------------------------
$ netstat -an | grep tcp | grep 8443
------------------------------------

==== `man netstat`

Run `man netstat` in your terminal window to learn more about this
command.

`netstat` (short for **net**work **stat**istics) is available on Unix,
Unix-like, and Windows NT-based operating systems. It is a command-line
tool that displays:

* network connections (both incoming and outgoing)
* routing tables
* and a number of network interface statistics

Look for the following in the output:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
tcp        0      0 :::8443              :::*                  LISTEN
---------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Troubleshooting

* Check the XML syntax in `server.xml` to make sure it is well-formed
and without error.
* When generating the self-signed certificate, the last password (the
`key password`) and `keystore password` should be the same (`changeit`).
If they differ, Tomcat cannot open the keystore and you will get this
error: `java.io.IOException: Cannot recover key`.
* Did you restart Tomcat after you made your changes to `server.xml`?
* Did you specify the full path to the `keystore` file in `server.xml`?

=== Configuring web applications for TLS/SSL

==== Looking Ahead

Other than the compelling security reasons, you will want to enable
TLS/SSL to take advantage of a couple of monitoring and debugging tools:
the http://localhost:8080/thredds/admin/debug[TDS Remote Management
Tool], and the <<tdsMonitor#,TdsMonitor Tool>> – both of which
(out-of-the-box) require TLS/SSL to access.

The web application deployment descriptor, aka `web.xml`, specifies if
all or parts of it need to be accessed via TLS/SSL.

Deployment descriptors are found in the `WEB-INF` directory of the web
application: `${tomcat_home}/webapps/application_name/WEB-INF/web.xml`.

By convention, Tomcat and other servlet containers will read the web
application deployment descriptors for initialization parameters and
container-managed security constraints upon application deployment.

_The TDS has been pre-configured to require that TLS/SSL encryption is
enabled in order to access the both the
http://localhost:8080/thredds/admin/debug[TDS Remote Management Tool],
and the <<tdsMonitor#,TdsMonitor Tool>>._

`web.xml` from the TDS Remote Management Tool:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <!-- This allows "remote configuration":
    /thredds/admin/debug gives access to various debug and status info.
    /thredds/admin/content/ -> "{tomcat_home}/content/thredds/"
    /thredds/admin/root/ -> "{tomcat_home}/webapps/thredds/" DISABLED
    /thredds/admin/dataDir/path -> "{dataRoot(path)}/webapps/thredds/"  DISABLED
   -->
  <security-constraint>
    <web-resource-collection>
      <web-resource-name>sensitive read access</web-resource-name>
      <url-pattern>/admin/*</url-pattern>
      <http-method>GET</http-method>
    </web-resource-collection>
    <auth-constraint>
      <role-name>tdsConfig</role-name>
    </auth-constraint>
    <user-data-constraint>
      <transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>
    </user-data-constraint>
  </security-constraint>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Configuration help

For more information on how to configure security requirements for a web
application in a deployment descriptor, see:
https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/partsecurity.htm#GIJRP[Defining
Security Requirements for Web Applications].

The `<user-data-constraint>` establishes a requirement that the
constrained requests be received over a protected transport layer
connection. This guarantees how the data will be transported between
client and server.

`<transport-guarantee>` choices for type of transport guarantee include
`NONE`, `INTEGRAL`, and `CONFIDENTIAL`:

1.  Specify `CONFIDENTIAL` when the application requires that data be
transmitted so as to prevent other entities from observing the contents
of the transmission. (E.g., via TLS/SSL.)
2.  Specify `INTEGRAL` when the application requires that the data be
sent between client and server in such a way that it cannot be changed
in transit.
3.  Specify `NONE` to indicate that the container must accept the
constrained requests on any connection, including an unprotected one.

===== Accessing TDS Monitoring and Debugging Tools

Other than the compelling security reasons, you will want to enable
TLS/SSL to take advantage of a couple of monitoring and debugging tools:
the http://localhost:8080/thredds/admin/debug[TDS Remote Management
Tool], and the <<tdsMonitor#,TdsMonitor Tool>> – both of which
(out-of-the-box) require TLS/SSL to access.

Enable TLS/SSL in Tomcat

If Tomcat has not already been configured to run via TLS/SSL, follow the
tutorial in the previous section to link:#sslinTomcat[Enable TLS/SSL in
Tomcat].

Modify `${tomcat_home}/conf/tomcat-users.xml` to add the new `tdsConfig`
and `tdsMonitor` roles. Add these roles to your list of roles:

--------------------------------------------------------------
<tomcat-users>
    <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
    <role rolename="tdsConfig"/>
      <role rolename="tdsMonitor"/>
    <user username="admin"
          password="e5e9fa1ba31ecd1ae84f75caaa474f3a663f05f4"
          roles="manager-gui,tdsConfig, tdsMonitor"/>
</tomcat-users>
--------------------------------------------------------------

== Securing the Tomcat `manager` Application

=== Changes to the `manager` application

The `manager` application URLs and roles has been re-structured. See the
Tomcat http://tomcat.apache.org/migration.html[Migration guide] for more
information.

=== Rationale

* ``Free'' web application that comes with Tomcat distribution that
lives in the Tomcat Lives in the `${tomcat_home}/webapps/manager`
directory.
* Not enabled by default.
* Allows Tomcat administrators to deploy, undeploy, or reload web
applications such as the TDS without having to shut down and restart
Tomcat.
* If exploited, an attacker can use the `manager` application to install
programs on your server willy-nilly.
* If you choose to enable the `manager` application, we _highly
recommend_ enabling digested passwords and TLS/SSL encryption for the
`manager`.
* Restricting access to the `manager` application to a small subset of
IP addressess or host names using a Tomcat valve, etc., is also a good
idea.
* Uninstall this application if you don’t plan to use it.

=== Enabling TLS/SSL for the Tomcat `manager` application

1.  Modify the deployment descriptor of the Tomcat `manager`
application.
2.  Verify TLS/SSL has been enabled for the Tomcat `manager`
application.
3.  NOTE: You will have to redo this every time you upgrade Tomcat.

==== Troubleshooting

* Check the XML syntax in `web.xml` to make sure it is well-formed and
without error.
* Did you specify a `<transport-guarantee>` of `CONFIDENTIAL`?
* Did you restart Tomcat after you made your changes to `web.xml`?

=== Resources

* http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/manager-howto.html[Manager App
HOW-TO] +
 The Apache Tomcat document referencing how to use and configure the
`manager` application.
* http://tomcat.apache.org/migration.html[Tomcat Migration Guide] +
 A document detailing the various changes between Tomcat versions
contains a section dedicated to the `manager` application.

== Blocking Non-Essential Port Access At The Firewall

=== Rationale

It is easy to issue commands to Tomcat if you know:

1.  the correct port number; and
2.  the command expected on that port.

Unless you are on a private network, you need a firewall to restrict who
is allowed to access network ports.

We recommend working with your systems/network administrator to block
access to all non-essential ports at the firewall.

=== For running the TDS, keep in mind the following:

* Port 8080 should have unrestricted access _unless_ you plan to proxy
requests to Tomcat from and HTTP server.
* If you are using any of the TDS monitoring and debugging tools, or the
Tomcat `manager` application, you must also open up port 8443.

=== Resources

* Your local systems/network administrator: +
 image:images/super.png[systems/network administrator]

== Restricting Access To The TDS By Remote IP Address Or Host

=== Rationale

==== Tomcat Valves

A http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/config/valve.html[valve]
element represents a component that will be inserted into the request
processing pipeline for the associated Catalina container.

* Use the Tomcat `RemoteHostValve` or `RemoteAddrValve` to restrict
access to the TDS and/or other web applications.
* Configured in the Tomcat `conf/server.xml` file.
* Valve declarations can be used to either _allow_ or _deny_ access to
content.
* Utilize the valves for adding an extra layer of security to the
`manager` application to limit accessed to it from within a specific IP
address range.
* Caveat: these valves rely on incoming IP addresses or hostnames which
are vulnerable to spoofing. Also, not much help when dealing with DHCP.

=== Examples

1.  Using the `RemoteAddrValve` to restrict access based on IP
addresses.
2.  Using the `RemoteHostValve` to restrict access based on resolved
host names.
3.  Using wildcard characters.
4.  Using the `RemoteAddrValve` to limit access to a specific range of
IP addresses.

=== Resources

* http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/config/valve.html[The Valve
Component] +
 Tomcat documentation about the various `valve` components available for
use.

== Reverse Proxy

=== Rationale

* A reverse proxy is a proxy server that appears to clients to be an
ordinary server. Requests are forwarded to one or more origin servers
which handle the request. The response is returned as if it came
directly from the proxy server.
* Reverse proxies can be used to hide the existence and characteristics
of the origin server(s) and can be an additional layer of defense and
can protect against some OS and web server specific attacks. This
additional security layer forces an attacker to attack the proxy because
the firewall allows only the proxy to communicate with the back-end
content servers.
* However, it does not provide any protection to attacks against
vulnerabilities in the web application or proxy service itself (e.g.,
Apache, Tomcat).
* If an attacker can use the front-end proxy server to launch an attack
on the back-end servers if he/she manages to exploit the web
application, proxy transaction or some other service running on the
proxy server.

=== Resources

* <<:../reference/TomcatBehindProxyServer[Running The TDS Behind
a Proxy Server>> +
 How to set up a reverse proxy for the TDS using Tomcat and the Apache
HTTP server.

== Running Tomcat with a Security Manager

=== Rationale

* The JVM Security Manager that comes with Tomcat imposes a fine-grained
security restrictions to all Java applications running the JVM.
* It confines the Java applications in a sandbox, and restricts them
from utilizing certain features of the Java language Tomcat normally is
able to access.
* If you are hosting untrusted servlets or JSP on your server, then
implementing the Security Manager may be a good idea.
* Be aware the Security Manager may prevent trusted web applications
(like the TDS) from performing certain functions if configured too
restrictively.

=== Resources

* http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/security.html[Security
Manager HOW-TO] +
 Information on the default settings of the Java Security Manager and
instructions on how to make changes to these settings.

== Protecting the Tomcat `SHUTDOWN` Port

=== `SHUTDOWN` on port 8005

* Tomcat uses a the default port of 8005 as the designated shutdown
port. Shutdown scripts make a call to this port and issue the `SHUTDOWN`
command.
* If need be, you can always change the shutdown command or even the
port number in `${tomcat_home}/conf/server.xml`.
